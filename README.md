 their ability to provide improved stability and precision. This paper presents the design, control, and analysis
 of “STEWIE”,whichisathree-degree-of-freedom(DoF)parallel manipulator robot developed by members
 of the thrustMIT rocketry team, as a payload stabilization mechanism for their sounding rocket, ’Altair’. The
 goal of the robot was to demonstrate the attitude control of the parallel plate against the continuous change
 in orientation experienced by the rocket during its flight, stabilizing the payloads. At the same time, the high
 gravitational forces (G-forces) and vibrations experienced by the sounding rocket are counteracted. A novel
 design of the mechanism, inspired by a standard Stewart platform, is proposed which was down-scaled to
 fit inside a 4U CubeSat within its space constraints. The robot uses three micro servo motors to actuate the
 links that control the alignment of the parallel plate. In addition to the actuation mechanism, a robust control
 system for its manipulation was developed for the robot. The robot represents a significant advancement
 in the field of space robotics in the aerospace industry by demonstrating the successful implementation of
 complex robotic mechanisms in small, confined spaces such as CubeSats, which are standard form factors
 for large payloads in the aerospace industry.
